# Poly Roadmap

## Must have features before V1 release in order of priority

* `insert`, `delete`, `replace` sequence methods -> Tim
* synthesis optimization -> Keoni, Nick, Milo, John
* cloning - goldengate, gibson, restriction, etc
* Primer Design CLI -> Milo, Nick, John

## Will likely need before V1 release

* SBOL3 IO -> James
* wetlab test case -> Keoni

## Planned features that may be released before or after V1

* Ribosome binding site calculator
* Non-repetitive parts calculator
* RNA folding
* `store`, `search`, `track`, and `diff` functions and CLI. -> Tim, Keoni

## Future features that may or may not be implemented (pie in the sky)

* API server for enterprise interop
* Integration of published machine learning models for things like [RNA folding](https://github.com/ml4bio/e2efold)


## Stability milestones

* ~100% code coverage (currently at 94%)
* Auto-documenation of command line tools.
* Adding windows support
* Integration testing of cross format IO.
* Internationalize documentation
* Improved error handling

## Feature upgrades

* Creating default codon tables for optimization based on RNA expression rather than codon frequency in CDS regions.
* Refactor and streamline `Sequence` struct

## Community milestones

* Get 700 github stars
* Get 50 feature requests
* Merge pull requests from 20 unique contributors
* Be used by ~100 individuals or academic labs
* Be used in production in 5 small companies
* Be used in production at 1 large company
* Get 100 paying sponsors
* Get 1 large leading sponsor
* Get 5 medium corporate sponsors
* Get 10 small corporate sponsors
* Grow our discord to ~50 active users
* Our community demographics at a bare minimum should match that of the US general population.

## Marketing milestones
