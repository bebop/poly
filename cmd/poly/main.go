/******************************************************************************
Oct, 15, 2020

This file is special because it is the entry point for our command line utility.
It also acts as a general template that outlines everything available to the user.

Initial argparsing and app definition is done entirely through
"github.com/urfave/cli/v2" for which you can find the docs here:

https://github.com/urfave/cli/blob/master/docs/v2/manual.md

Essentially poly's app is defined via the &cli.App{} struct which you initialize
with data needed to run your app. In our case we're providing it Name, Usage, Flags,
and Commands at the top level. Commands can also be nested to provide n-level sub commands.

When naming new flags please make sure they don't collide with already existent
flags and try to follow these naming conventions:

Happy hacking,
Tim
