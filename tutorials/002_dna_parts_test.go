As you'll discover throughout this book we are, in fact, the gray goo.

In general DNA stores genes which are then transcribed into RNA which are then
translated into amino acids which are assembled into nanobots that we call proteins.

This model is typically called, "The Central Dogma of Biology".

All of this molecular machinery is self replicating and DNA is the long term
storage medium for the instructions used to makes these nanobots (proteins).

There are many different types of DNA parts, and there are probably more than
I even know about.

Below we'll see how can we can use Poly to explore an annotated DNA sequence's
parts.


TTFN,
