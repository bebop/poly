== Forward from Myself (Tim) ==

To my knowledge this is the first book on computational synthetic biology with
real, live, running examples that you can modify and play with. Heck, it may
be the first "book" on computational synthetic biology period as far as I know.

It feels strange for me to be the first author to write this sort of thing for
a field that's already been around for 20 ~years but here I am.

When I first entered the field there wasn't anything even close to resembling
a software framework for engineering organisms and even today Poly (the library
I created and maintain that we'll be using throughout this "book") is the
closest thing we have.

For a couple of years now I've had friends and strangers tell me that I needed
to ship a set of real tutorials to get people started with this special
little library but I just couldn't find the right medium to ship a stable,
deployable, and accessible tutorial series until today.

This book is built into Poly's source code itself. Each tutorial a series
of runnable integration tests guaranteed to stay up to date with
each new release of Poly. It's my hope that you, the reader, will take the
tutorials here, make them your own, and then share your changes with the world
and me!

I don't by any means consider Poly or its accompanying sibling projects
to be complete. There's far more to do than what's already been done and
I'm always looking for new friends, contributors, and fun things to do.
Dive in and join me. The water is weird and full of squishy things.

TTFN,
Tim
