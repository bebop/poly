Package poly is a Go package for engineering organisms.

Synthetic biology has a software problem. I.E almost all
of our field's software is slow, hard to maintain,
and even harder to deploy.

Poly solves that problem by providing a highly tested
suite of common functions for engineering organisms
through a simple interface in Go.

The reason why Go was choosen is that it's a highly popular
language with a simple sytax and a large ecosystem of packages
that make it *extremely* easy to learn, use, and deploy.
It's also on average 25X faster and more energy efficient that
Python.

Eventually we intend for poly to provide all the functionality
needed such that users can use it to engineer proteins which
they can then optimize and insert into their organisms of choice.

We've made great progress and are always looking for more support!

If you can help us out, please consider opening a pull request,
starring a repo, or best of all, throwing some money at our lead
maintainer so he can keep the project going:
