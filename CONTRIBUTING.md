# Introduction

Yo, what up! if you're reading this then I'm super psyched because that means that you're thinking about contributing to poly! Thanks so much for your time and consideration. It's rad people like you that make Poly such a cool computational synthetic biology tool.

I wrote this contributor's guide to help newcomers feel welcome. Getting started with a new project can be complicated and I wanted to make it as easy as possible for you to contribute and as easy as possible for me to help. I'll try to keep it brief so please read along so that we all know what to expect when expecting your most excellent pull request (or any other excellent contribution).

Currently any sincere pull request is a good request. Poly is still super alpha (as of writing it kinda parses genbank files) so there are so many way to contribute! Here's a list of ideas but feel free to suggest anything I may have forgotten to include.

* Feature requests - especially cool new algorithms with citations
* Unit and integration tests
* Writing and translating tutorials, documentation, or blog posts.
* Auditing for accessibility
* Bug reports
* Bug triaging
* Community management
* Art! Dreams! Your excellence!
* Code that can be pulled into Poly itself.

# What to expect when you're expecting to contribute to Poly
### Excellence, and the contributor's code of conduct

First up, most importantly we have a contributor's code of conduct. For some reason the internet is a dehumanizing experience and it's easy to forgot that aside from the bots we're all humans on this thing. Approach each other with kindness. Please read our [contributor's code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and when in doubt just remember our one true rule as once spoken by the ever so wise duo of Bill and Ted.

>Bill: Be excellent, ... to each other, ...

>Ted: and party on, dudes! [sic]

### Do-ocracy

Poly runs on do-ocracy. Do-ocracy is a simple concept. If you don't like something you don't need permission to fix it, you can just go ahead and fix it! If you actually want to merge your fix, or contribute in someway that benefits everybody, it'd really, really, really help if you got some light consensus from the rest of the poly development community but hey, if you really need to do something then you just gotta do it! Just don't expect me to merge it if it doesn't meet our technical criteria or isn't quite right for poly.

### Technical requirements

Part of what makes Poly so special is that we have standards. DNA is already spaghetti code on its own and we just don't need to add to that.

All successfully merged pull requests must include the following: 

* All current tests must pass.
 
* At least one new test must be written to prove that the merged feature works correctly.
  
* Build tests must pass for all currently supported systems and package managers. Linux, Mac OSX, Windows, etc.
  
* Code must be clean, readable, and commented. How you do that is up to you!

Don't worry if you submit a pull request and all the tests break and the codes not readable. We won't merge it just yet and then you can get some feedback about what needs to be changed before we do!

## Be diverse
As one final guideline please be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. I want Poly to be for everyone and that includes you and people who don't look, sound, or act like you!


# Your First Contribution
Help people who are new to your project understand where they can be most helpful. This is also a good time to let people know if you follow a label convention for flagging beginner issues.

> Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
> Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
> Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
> Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### Bonus points: Add a link to a resource for people who have never contributed to open source before.
Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

> Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

As a side note, it helps to use newcomer-friendly language throughout the rest of your document. Here are a couple of examples from [Active Admin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md):

>At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:
>
>If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started
### Give them a quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution.
How you write this is up to you, but some things you may want to include:

* Let them know if they need to sign a CLA, agree to a DCO, or get any other legal stuff out of the way
* If tests are required for contributions, let them know, and explain how to run the tests
* If you use anything other than GitHub to manage issues (ex. JIRA or Trac), let them know which tools they’ll need to contribute

>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with the jQuery Foundation.
    * Note the jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

### If you have a different process for small or "obvious" fixes, let them know.

> Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.
>
>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
### Explain security disclosures first!
At bare minimum, include this sentence:
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email XXXX instead.

If you don’t want to use your personal contact information, set up a “security@” email address. Larger projects might have more formal processes for disclosing security, including encrypted communication. (Disclosure: I am not a security expert.)

> Any security issues should be submitted directly to security@travis-ci.org
> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at security@travis-ci.org.

### Tell your contributors how to file a bug report.
You can even include a template so people can just copy-paste (again, less work for you).

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of Go are you using (go version)?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?
> General questions should go to the golang-nuts mailing list instead of the issue tracker. The gophers there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
### If you have a particular roadmap, goals, or philosophy for development, share it here.
This information will give contributors context before they make suggestions that may not align with the project’s needs.

> The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.
>
> Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over 14 template engines via Consolidate.js, you can quickly craft your perfect framework.

[source: [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express#philosophy)] **Need more inspiration?** [Active Admin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin#goals)

### Explain your desired process for suggesting a feature.
If there is back-and-forth or signoff required, say so. Ask them to scope the feature, thinking through why it’s needed and how it might work.

> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Elasticsearch, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Elasticsearch has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process
### Explain how a contribution gets accepted after it’s been submitted.
Who reviews it? Who needs to sign off before it’s accepted? When should a contributor expect to hear from you? How can contributors get commit access, if at all?

> The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting that we hold in a public Google Hangout. The hangout is announced in the weekly status updates that are sent to the puppet-dev list. Notes are posted to the Puppet Community community-triage repo and include a link to a YouTube recording of the hangout.
> After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Community
If there are other channels you use besides GitHub to discuss contributions, mention them here. You can also list the author, maintainers, and/or contributors here, or set expectations for response time.

> You can chat with the core team on https://gitter.im/cucumber/cucumber. We try to have office hours on Fridays.

# BONUS: Code, commit message and labeling conventions
These sections are not necessary, but can help streamline the contributions you receive.

### Explain your preferred style for code, if you have any.
