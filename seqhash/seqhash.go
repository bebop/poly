Package seqhash contains the seqhash algorithm.

This package contains the reference seqhash algorithm.

There is a big problem with current sequence databases - they all use different
identifiers and accession numbers. This means cross-referencing databases is
a complicated exercise, especially as the quantity of databases increases, or if
you need to compare "wild" DNA sequences.

Seqhash is a simple algorithm to produce consistent identifiers for any genetic sequence. The
basic premise of the Seqhash algorithm is to hash sequences with the hash being a robust
cross-database identifier. Sequences themselves shouldn't be used as a database index
(often, they're too big), so a hash based off of a sequence is the next best thing.

Usability wise, you should be able to Seqhash any rotation of a sequence in any direction and
get a consistent hash.

The Seqhash algorithm makes several opinionated design choices, primarily to make working
with Seqhashes more consistent and nice. The Seqhash algorithm only uses a single hash function,
Blake3, and only operates on DNA, RNA, and Protein sequences. These identifiers will be seen
by human beings, so versioning and metadata is attached to the front of the hashes so that
a human operator can quickly identify problems with hashing.

If the sequence is DNA or RNA, the Seqhash algorithm needs to know whether or not the nucleic
acid is circular and/or double stranded. If circular, the sequence is rotated to a deterministic
point. If double stranded, the sequence is compared to its reverse complement, and the lexicographically
minimal sequence is taken (whether or not the min or max is used doesn't matter, just needs to
be consistent).

If the sequence is RNA, the sequence will be converted to DNA before hashing. While the full Seqhash
will still be different between RNA and DNA (due to the metadata string), the hash afterwards will be the same.
This makes it easy to cross reference DNA and RNA sequences. This fact is important for parts of Poly
store that relate to storing and searching large quantities of sequences - deduplication can easily
be used on those Seqhashes to save a lot of space.

For DNA or RNA sequences, only ATUGCYRSWKMBDHVNZ characters are allowed. For Proteins,
only ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYUO*BXZ characters are allowed in sequences. Selenocysteine (Sec; U) and pyrrolysine
(Pyl; O) are included in the protein character set - usually U and O don't occur within protein sequences,
but for certain organisms they do, and it is certainly a relevant amino acid for those particular proteins.

# Seqhash version 1

A version 1 seqhash is separated into 3 different elements divided by underscores. It looks like the following:

v1_DCD_4b0616d1b3fc632e42d78521deb38b44fba95cca9fde159e01cd567fa996ceb9

The first element is the version tag (v1 for version 1). If there is ever a Seqhash version 2, this tag
will differentiate seqhashes. The second element is the metadata tag, which has 3 letters. The first letter
codes for the sequenceType (D for DNA, R for RNA, and P for Protein). The second letter codes for whether or
not the sequence is circular (C for Circular, L for Linear). The final letter codes for whether or not the
sequence is double stranded (D for Double stranded, S for Single stranded). The final element is the blake3
hash of the sequence (once rotated and complemented, as stated above).

# Seqhash version 2

Version 1 seqhashes are rather long, and version 2 seqhashes are built to be
much shorter. The intended use case are for handling sequences with LLM systems
since these system's context window is a value resource, and smaller references
allows the system to be more focused. Seqhash version 2 are approximately 3x
smaller than version 1 seqhashes. Officially, they are [16]byte arrays, but can
be also encoded with base64 to get a hash that can be used as a string across
different systems. Here is a length comparison:

	version 1: v1_DLD_f4028f93e08c5c23cbb8daa189b0a9802b378f1a1c919dcbcf1608a615f46350
	version 2: C_JPQCj5PgjFwjy7jaoYmwqQ==

The metadata is now encoded in a 1 byte flag rather than a metadata string,
instead of 7 rune like in version 1. Rather than use 256 bits for encoding
the hash, we use 120 bits. Since seqhashes are not meant for security, this
is good enough (50% collision with 1.3x10^18 hashes), while making them
conveniently only 16 btyes long. Additionally, encoded prefixes are added
to the front of the base64 encoded hash as a heuristic device for LLMs while
processing batches of seqhashes.

In addition, seqhashes can now encode fragments. Fragments are double stranded
DNA that are the result of restriction digestion, with single stranded
overhangs flanking both sides. These fragments can encode genetic parts - and
an important part of any vector containing these parts would be the part
seqhash, rather than the vector seqhash. This enhancement allows you to
identify genetic parts irregardless of their context.
