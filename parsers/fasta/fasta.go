 Parser begins here

Many thanks to Jordan Campbell (https://github.com/0x106) for building the first
parser for Poly and thanks to Tim Stiles (https://github.com/TimothyStiles)
for helping complete that PR. This work expands on the previous work by allowing
for concurrent  parsing and giving Poly a specific  parser subpackage,
as well as few bug fixes.

 is a very simple file format for working with DNA, RNA, or protein sequences.
It was first released in 1985 and is still widely used in bioinformatics.

One interesting use of the concurrent  parser is working with the Uniprot
 dump files, which are far too large to fit into RAM. This parser is able
to easily handle those files by doing computation actively while the data dump
is getting parsed.

I have removed the  Parsers from the io.go file and moved them into this
subpackage.
