/*
Package align is a package for aligning (comparing) DNA, RNA, and protein sequences.

Biology is fickle and full of quirks that make it hard to do even the most basic of tasks
which we would normally take for granted when working with other kinds of data.

Comparing two biogical sequences to see if they're roughly equivalent is one of those tasks.

Essentially two almost identical sequences with almost identical functionality can contain
small insertions or deletions that shift the entire string such that a meaningful comparison via
hamming distance or levenshtein distance becomes impossible.

For example:

Timothy Stiles
||||||| ||||||
Timothy Stiles

is an easy match with hamming or levenshtein distance.

However, say we introduce a new character to the beginning of the sequence.

Timothy Stiles
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
A Timothy Stiles

Now our edit distance via levenshtein is maximized at 16 and we wouldn't
be able to tell that semantically these strings are almost identical.

This frame shifting seen above is incredibly common within biological sequences and alignment
algorithms are designed in part to deal with these shifts so that when we compare two sequences
like the two below we can get a more useful edit distance.

As of writing this package includes the two most basic algorithms for alignment,
Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman.

Both are "dynamic programming algorithms" which is a fancy 1980's term for they use
matrices. If you're familiar with kernel operations, linear filters, or whatever term
ML researchers are using nowadays for, "slide a window over a matrix and determine that
entry's values using its neighbor's values", then this should be pretty easy to grok.

If not these algorithms essentially compare every character in one sequence with another
sequence and create an edit distance along with human readable string to show gaps like the
previous example.

I'm not really an expert on alignment so if you want to learn more about this class of algorithms
wikipedia has a decent overview.

Even if I may not know the answer to your alignment questions please ask and I'll do my best
to help!
