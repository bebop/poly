/*
Package fasta contains fasta parsers and writers.

Fasta is a flat text file format developed in 1985 to store nucleotide and
amino acid sequences. It is extremely simple and well-supported across many
languages. However, this simplicity means that annotation of genetic objects
is not supported.

This package provides a parser and writer for working with Fasta formatted
genetic sequences.

Fasta Parser begins here

Many thanks to Jordan Campbell (https://github.com/0x106) for building the first
parser for Poly and thanks to Tim Stiles (https://github.com/TimothyStiles)
for helping complete that PR. This work expands on the previous work by allowing
for concurrent  parsing and giving Poly a specific  parser subpackage,
as well as few bug fixes.

Fasta is a very simple file format for working with DNA, RNA, or protein sequences.
It was first released in 1985 and is still widely used in bioinformatics.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/_format

One interesting use of the concurrent  parser is working with the Uniprot
fasta dump files, which are far too large to fit into RAM. This parser is able
to easily handle those files by doing computation actively while the data dump
is getting parsed.

I have removed the  Parsers from the io.go file and moved them into this
subpackage.
