Package clone provides functions for cloning DNA sequences.

Since 1973, the most common way to make recombinant DNA has been restriction
enzyme cloning (though lately, homologous recombination based methods like
Gibson assembly have attracted a lot of use). The cloning functions here allow
for simulation of restriction enzyme cloning.

For a historical review leading up to the discovery:
https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1313397110

The idea of restriction enzyme cloning is that you can cut DNA at specific
locations with restriction enzyme and then glue them back together in different
patterns using ligase. The final product is (99.9% of the time) a circular plasmid
that you can transform into a bacterial cell for propagation.

While simulation is simple for simple cases, there are a lot of edge cases to handle, for example:
  - Which input sequences are circular? How do we handle their rotations?
  - Is the enzyme that is cutting directional? How do we handle that directionality?
  - Are there multiple possible outputs of our ligation reaction? For example, ligations may be
    able to create a "library" of plasmids, in which there are millions of valid combinations.
  - How do we handle sequences that get ligated in multiple orientations?

These cloning functions handle all those problems so that they appear simple to the end user.

In particular, there is a focus here on GoldenGate Assembly:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Cloning
https://www.neb.com/applications/cloning-and-synthetic-biology/dna-assembly-and-cloning/golden-gate-assembly

GoldenGate is a particular kind of restriction enzyme cloning reaction that you can do
in a single tube and that is extraordinarily efficient (up to 50 parts) and is popular
for new modular DNA part toolkits. Users can easily simulate GoldenGate assembly reactions
with just their input fragments + the enzyme name.

Let's build some DNA!

# Keoni

PS: We do NOT (yet) handle restriction enzymes which recognize one site but cut
in multiple places (Type IIG enzymes) such as BcgI.
